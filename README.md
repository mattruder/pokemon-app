# Pokemon App

- The purpose of this app was to give myself experience in React, by creating a basic app that pulls data from the public Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/) and displays it. On page load, a random Pokemon from the original 150 is generated, and a user can either continue generating random Pokemon or choose one to view the details of from the View All button.
